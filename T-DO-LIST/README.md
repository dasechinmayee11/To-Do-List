## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project implements a comprehensive DevOps pipeline with the following stages:

### 1. Source Code Management
- Code hosted on GitHub
- Branch protection rules
- Pull request workflow

### 2. Continuous Integration
- Automated builds triggered by commits
- ESLint code quality checks
- Unit testing with Jest
- SonarQube code analysis

### 3. Containerization
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Optimized production images
- Security scanning with Trivy

### 4. Deployment
- Staging environment deployment
- Integration testing
- Production deployment approval
- Zero-downtime deployment strategies
